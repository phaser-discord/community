# Longer Code of Conduct

Last Updated: 2018-03-10; v1.0

This code seeks to outline the guiding principles behind how we want to build
and grow our community. To that end we ask that all members of the community
uphold this code when interacting with each other inside (and even outside!)
the bounds of our group.

## Principles / Creed

As a member of this community we aim to be welcoming and helpful. People in
this group should feel comfortable asking questions and should have a positive
experience learning with us.

Our community creed:

1. I will be welcoming regardless of age, ethnicity, sexuality, gender,
   experience, nationality, etc.
2. I will assume the best intentions of my peers and engage them with a helpful
   attitude.
3. I will remember that everybody starts somewhere and my commentary will
   be constructive, attempting to build up and teach instead of belittling
   with my answers.

## Moderation Pledge

Ideally we will succeed as a community without any problems. Should that not
be the case the moderation team is available and you should feel free to
ask for help via DM. Currently that team is all volunteer and composed of:

- @16patsle#7801
- @jdotr#9225
- @Arcan#8543

When you come to us please provide as much context as you can about the situation
you are reporting. We promise that your identity and report will remain
confidential unless you explicitly grant us permission otherwise. We will
keep you informed about the status of your report and any action taken as a
result.

# Longest Code of Conduct

## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
community members pledge to making participation a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation. This is a long but intentionally incomplete list.

### For Example...

Behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment may include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Assume good intentions of your peers within the community
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Behavior that does not contribute to a positive environment may include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Any action taken in retaliation to a report of a code of conduct violation
  including, but not limited to: a continuation of the reported unwelcome
  or outside of the community
  actions, threats, actions to undermine the perceived reporters status inside

## Responsibilities

Moderators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that
are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently
any member for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both in server and in public spaces (virtual and
physical) when an individual is representing the community.

Examples of representing the community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting a member of the moderation team via DM. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated
to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Unless
specifically requested each report will be shared with each member of the
moderation team for discussiong prior to any enforcement action. If a member of
the moderation team is the subject of the complaint they will not be involved
in an enforcement decision or be informed of the reporter.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

Enforcement action typically (but not always) will follow a pattern of warning
and a discussion of why the behavior in question is unacceptable, limited
duration ban, and finally a lifetime ban. Punishment escalation may or may not
be aggregated over disparite instances, e.g., if someone has been warned for
trolling the next disiplinary action for an unrelated offense may be a limited
ban.
